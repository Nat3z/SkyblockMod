## Song Configurations
To use the NSM Music Player, you need to first download your music. Once you have downloaded all of the music files, if they are mp3s or oggs, convert them to .mov files. Once you have done that, go to .minecraft\config\nsm_playlist\ then drag all of your songs in. In-game, do /refreshplaylist and that's it!
